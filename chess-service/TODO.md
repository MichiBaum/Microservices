# AI Database and Repository Optimizations

This document is generated by an AI and contains **Ideas** to optimize the chess service.
This document outlines optimizations for the database schema, Flyway migrations, and repository design for improving performance, maintainability, and scalability.

## **1. Entity Design Optimizations**

### a. Relationships and Fetch Strategies
- **Lazy Loading for Collections and References:**
    - Use `FetchType.LAZY` for `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` relationships unless eager loading is strictly required. For example:
      ```kotlin
      @OneToMany(mappedBy = "game", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = [CascadeType.ALL])
      val players: Set<Player>
      ```
    - Eager fetching can lead to unnecessary data being loaded and performance bottlenecks.

- **TargetEntity Attribute:**
    - The `targetEntity` attribute (e.g., `@ManyToOne(targetEntity = ChessEngine::class)`) is redundant unless polymorphism is explicitly needed. Remove it for clarity.

### b. Bidirectional Relationships
- Avoid bidirectional relationships unless navigation is frequently required from both ends. Simplify relationships where possible to reduce complexity and circular dependencies in queries.

### c. UUID as Primary Key
- While using UUIDs as primary keys is useful for scalability and uniqueness, they may impact query performance due to their size. For performance-critical tables, consider adding surrogate keys (e.g., auto-incremented integers) for indexing purposes.

---

## **2. Indexing & Queries**

### a. Indexes
- Evaluate indexing strategies for common query patterns:
    - Use composite indexes to improve multi-column queries. For example, index `(platform_id, username)` in the `account` table for better filtering performance.

- Add covering indexes for fields involved in sorting and filtering:
    - Example indexes for queries on `platform`:
      ```sql
      CREATE INDEX idx_account_platform_username ON account (platform, username);
      ```

- Introduce partial indexes where soft-delete logic is in use:
    ```sql
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_active_openings ON opening(id)
    WHERE deleted = false;
    ```

### b. Recursive Queries in Repositories
Recursive queries, like those in `OpeningMoveRepository`, are useful but potentially expensive. To optimize:
- Profile these queries using database tools like `EXPLAIN`.
- If performance issues arise, explore caching intermediate results or precomputing the hierarchy.

### c. Pagination and Query Depth
- Use Spring's `Pageable` to enforce pagination for large datasets:
    ```kotlin
    fun findByFirstnameContainingIgnoreCase(firstname: String, pageable: Pageable): List<Person>
    ```
    - This minimizes memory pressure and improves API performance.

---

## **3. Flyway Migrations**

### a. Consolidation of Schema Changes
- Avoid complex migrations that combine multiple schema updates in one step to reduce downtime. Split larger updates into smaller steps.
- When altering large datasets (e.g., ENUM columns), perform updates in batches to minimize locking issues.

### b. Script Maintenance
- Remove redundant operations such as multiple table recreations or unnecessary index drops.
- Always check for value existence before altering ENUMs or foreign keys to ensure safe migrations.

---

## **4. Repository Design Optimizations**

### a. Specifications and Projections
- Use `JpaSpecificationExecutor` for building dynamic queries instead of writing multiple specialized query methods:
    ```kotlin
    interface EventRepository : JpaRepository<Event, UUID>, JpaSpecificationExecutor<Event>
    ```

- Create DTOs or Projections to reduce result size:
  ```kotlin
  data class AccountDto(val id: UUID, val username: String, val platform: ChessPlatform)
  data class PersonDto(val id: UUID, val firstname: String, val lastname: String, val accounts: List<AccountDto>)
  ```

### b. Avoid Native Queries
- Prefer JPQL or Criteria API over native SQL for better maintainability:
    ```kotlin
    @Query("SELECT e FROM Event e WHERE e.dateFrom > :recent AND e.dateTo < :upcoming")
    fun findByDateRange(@Param("recent") recent: LocalDate, @Param("upcoming") upcoming: LocalDate): List<Event>
    ```

---

## **5. DTO Mapping and Data Transfer**

- Map JPA entities to DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for API responses to avoid exposing full internal structures:
  ```kotlin
  data class OpeningDto(val id: UUID, val name: String, val deleted: Boolean)
  ```

- Use libraries like MapStruct for automatic entity-to-DTO mapping to reduce boilerplate.

---

## **6. Enum and Data Constraints**

### Enum Usage
- Validate enums at the application level to handle unexpected input:
    ```kotlin
    fun safeChessPlatform(platform: String): ChessPlatform =
        try { ChessPlatform.valueOf(platform.uppercase()) } catch (e: IllegalArgumentException) { ChessPlatform.UNKNOWN }
    ```

- For databases, consider mapping enums to integers (`@Enumerated(EnumType.ORDINAL)`) where the string label is unnecessary, reducing storage space and improving performance.

---

## **7. Soft Deletes**

- Implement global filters or query hints in Hibernate/Spring JPA to exclude soft-deleted entries automatically:
  ```java
  @Query("SELECT o FROM Opening o WHERE o.deleted = false")
  fun findAllActiveOpenings(): List<Opening>
  ```

- Combine partial indexes (`WHERE deleted = false`) with soft-delete logic for optimized queries.

---

## **8. Testing with TestContainers**

### Integration Testing
- Utilize TestContainers for Flyway migrations and schema validation during integration tests.
- Create sample datasets for testing critical queries (e.g., `findMoveChildren`, `findMoveHierarchyBefore`).

---

## **9. JSON Log Payloads**

- Serialize complex relational data (e.g., opening hierarchies) to JSON for efficient logging and debugging.
- Example:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
      "name": "Sicilian Defense",
      "moves": ["e4", "c5"]
    }
    ```

This standardizes how relational data is logged or cached, facilitating easier debugging and improving operational insights.

## **10. Final Considerations**

- Regularly review and profile database queries, especially those involving joins or recursive operations.
- Simplify cascading behaviors in relationships to avoid unintended mass data updates or deletions.
- Audit and optimize indexes whenever data grows significantly or query patterns change.
