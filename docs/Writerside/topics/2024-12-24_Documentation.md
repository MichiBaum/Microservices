# 2024-12-24 Documentation

Should documentation be written in a JetBrains Writerside project or in loosely Markdowns spread through the whole project?

## Pros Writerside
- Structural and visual help from Writerside
- Can be exported to html to github page
- All documentation in one place


## Cons Writerside
- Needs Writerside Idea or IntelliJ with Writerside plugin


## Pros loose Markdowns
- No need for a Idea or IntelliJ plugin


## Cons loose Markdowns
- There are all over the place (root Readme, Readme in services, Readme under docs)


## Decision
The decision is made to move all documentation (markdowns, local files on Computer etc.) into a Writerside project under docs.
