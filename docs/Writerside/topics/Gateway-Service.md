# Gateway Service

The Gateway Service is a microservice built with Spring Boot that serves as the entry point for all client requests to the microservices architecture. It routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservices, providing a unified interface for clients.

## Key Features

- **Request Routing**: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on the request path or other criteria.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple instances of the same service.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Verifies user identity and permissions before forwarding requests.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single client.
- **Circuit Breaking**: Prevents cascading failures by detecting and isolating failing services.
- **Request/Response Transformation**: Modifies requests and responses as needed (e.g., adding headers, transforming data formats).
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Tracks all incoming requests for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## Benefits

- **Simplified Client Interface**: Clients only need to know about a single endpoint.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Centralizes common functionality like authentication and logging.
- **Reduced Client-Service Coupling**: Changes to the service landscape don't require client changes.
- **Enhanced Security**: Provides a single point for implementing security measures.
- **Improved Performance**: Enables caching and request aggregation.
