| IPI   | Interested Party Information           | IPI is a unique identifying number assigned by the CISAC database to each Interested Party in collective rights management. It is used worldwide by more than 120 countries and three million right holders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|       | Track                                  | Material (music or sounds) is stored on an album in sections termed tracks. A music track (often simply referred to as a track) is an individual song or instrumental recording. The term is particularly associated with popular music where separate tracks are known as album tracks; the term is also used for other formats such as EPs and singles.                                                                                                                 |
|       | Track list                             | A track listing (also called a track list or tracklist) is a list created in connection with a recorded medium to indicate the contents of that medium and their order. The most typical usage of a track listing is for songs or other discrete segments on an album.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|       | Title Track                            | A track that has the same name as the album is called a title track, although an album may instead have a title that is different from the titles of any songs on the album.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|       | Bonus track                            | A bonus track (also known as a bonus cut or bonus) is a piece of music which has been included as an extra. This may be done as a marketing promotion, or for other reasons. It is not uncommon to include singles, B-sides, live recordings, and demo recordings as bonus tracks on re-issues of old albums, where those tracks were not originally included.                                                                                                            |
|       | Album                                  | An album is a collection of audio recordings (e.g., music) issued on a medium such as compact disc (CD), vinyl (record), audio tape (like 8-track or cassette), or digital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| EP    | Extended play                          | An EP is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single but fewer than an album. Contemporary EPs generally contain up to eight tracks and have a playing time of 15 to 30 minutes. An EP is usually less cohesive than an album and more "non-committal".                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|       | Single                                 | A single is a type of release of a song recording of fewer tracks than an album (LP), typically one or two tracks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|       | Artist                                 | An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art. The most common usage (in both everyday speech and academic discourse) refers to a practitioner in the visual arts only. However, the term is also often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (although less often for actors).                                                   |
|       | Musician                               | A musician is someone who composes, conducts, or performs music. Musicians include songwriters, who write both music and lyrics for songs; conductors, who direct a musical performance; and performers, who perform for an audience. A music performer is generally either a singer (also known as a vocalist), who provides vocals, or an instrumentalist, who plays a musical instrument. Musicians may perform on their own or as part of a group, band or orchestra. |
