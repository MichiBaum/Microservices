==== Message #1 ====
User: 
After 1-2 days my kubernetes is somehow not reachable anymore. Why could this happen? Is there a mistake in traefik, metallb or my services like gateway-service or something else?

kotlin.Unit

==== Message #2 ====
Assistant: 
Of course, I can help you with that. I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your Kubernetes cluster. Let's investigate this together.

There can be many reasons why a Kubernetes cluster becomes unreachable after a certain amount of time. It could be related to network policies, resource exhaustion, or misconfiguration in one of the components you mentioned.

To start, I need to get a better understanding of your project structure. Could you please provide me with a list of all files in your project? That would help me to locate the configuration files for Traefik, MetalLB, and your services, and to check for any potential issues.

User: 
All the files are under /kubernetes. this is my whole setup

==== Message #4 ====
Assistant: 
Thank you for providing the configuration files. I've reviewed them, and I have a few initial observations.

A significant portion of your infrastructure, including all your databases (`authentication-db`, `usermanagement-db`, `chess-db`, `fitness-db`, `music-db`), monitoring components (`prometheus`, `grafana`), and `zipkin-storage` are all scheduled to run on a single node: `35591.hostserv.eu`.

This is configured using a `nodeSelector` in the deployments. Additionally, your MetalLB configuration is set up to advertise the IP address `185.229.90.248`, which is the IP address of that same node.

This creates a single point of failure. If the `35591.hostserv.eu` node becomes unhealthy or overloaded for any reason, it would cause all of those services to fail and would also make your cluster unreachable from the outside, which aligns with the problem you've described. The fact that it takes 1-2 days for the issue to appear could suggest a resource leak (like memory or disk space) on that specific node.

To investigate further and give you more specific recommendations, I need to see the complete list of files in your `/kubernetes` directory. This will help me understand if there are any other configuration files, for example for Traefik or for the services, that I should look at.

I will now list all the files in the `/kubernetes` directory.Thank you for providing the file list. I can see a comprehensive setup for a microservices architecture.

Based on the files, I can see you are using `MetalLB` for load balancing and have a `gateway-service` which likely acts as an API gateway for your microservices. However, I don't see any configuration files for Traefik, which you mentioned as a potential source of the problem.

To investigate further, could you please provide the Traefik configuration files? I'm particularly interested in the Traefik Deployment/StatefulSet, its Service, and any Ingress or Gateway resources that are used to expose your services through Traefik.

In the meantime, I'll start by examining the `metallb-config.yaml` and `gateway-service.yaml` files for any potential issues.

==== Message #6 ====
Assistant: 
Thank you for the additional information. Your `k0sctl.yaml` confirms that you're installing Traefik via a Helm chart, and the `Ingress` resource in `gateway-service.yaml` is the standard way to expose a service through it. Your Traefik setup itself is likely not the problem.

However, after reviewing your configuration, I've identified a critical architectural issue that is the most probable cause of your cluster becoming unreachable.

### The Single Point of Failure

Your entire setup has a single point of failure on the node `35591.hostserv.eu` (with IP `185.229.90.248`). Here's why:

1.  **Network Entry Point**: Your `metallb-config.yaml` is configured to provide only one external IP address: `185.229.90.248`. This means all external traffic, handled by Traefik's LoadBalancer service, is routed exclusively through this single node.
2.  **Stateful Workloads**: All of your stateful applications, including all your databases (music-db, chess-db, etc.), Prometheus, and Grafana, are forced to run on this *same node* using a `nodeSelector`.
3.  **Local Storage**: You are using `local-storage` `PersistentVolume`s which are physically located on that specific node.

This means if the node `35591.hostserv.eu` becomes overloaded, runs out of resources (memory, CPU, disk), or fails for any reason, your entire application stack—from the ingress point to the databases—will go down. The 1-2 day timeframe strongly suggests a gradual resource leak or increasing resource pressure on that node, eventually causing it to become unresponsive.

### How to Fix It: Building a Resilient Architecture

To solve this, you need to distribute your workloads and eliminate the single point of failure. Here are the recommended steps:

#### Step 1: Make Your Network Highly Available

You have another worker node, `nbs1` (`91.99.143.250`), but it's not being used for external traffic. You should add its IP address to your MetalLB configuration.

<llm-snippet-file>kubernetes/metallb-config.yaml</llm-snippet-file>
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: public-ips
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 185.229.90.248/32
    - 91.99.143.250/32 # Add the IP of your other worker node
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: public-ips-advertisement
  namespace: metallb-system

```

This allows MetalLB to serve traffic from either worker node, so if one goes down, the other can take over.

#### Step 2: Distribute Your Stateful Applications

Pinning stateful applications to a single node defeats the purpose of having a multi-node cluster. You need to configure them to run on any available worker node. This requires moving away from `local-storage`.

You already have the OpenEBS Helm chart installed, which is excellent. OpenEBS can provide replicated storage that isn't tied to a single node.

Here is the plan to transition your databases (the process is the same for Prometheus, Grafana, etc.):

1.  **IMPORTANT**: **Back up your data before proceeding!** These changes can be destructive if not done carefully.

2.  **Identify a replicated OpenEBS StorageClass.** Your OpenEBS installation should have created one or more `StorageClass` resources. Find one that offers replication (e.g., using cStor or Jiva). You can list available classes by running:
    ```bash
    kubectl get sc
    ```
    Look for a class like `openebs-cstor-csi` or `openebs-jiva-csi-default`.

3.  **Remove the `nodeSelector`** from your stateful `Deployment` files. For example, in `authentication-db.yaml`:

    <llm-snippet-file>kubernetes/authentication-db.yaml</llm-snippet-file>
    ```yaml
    # ... (metadata and other specs)
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        # ...
      template:
        metadata:
          # ...
        spec:
          # REMOVE THIS BLOCK
          # nodeSelector:
          #  kubernetes.io/hostname: 35591.hostserv.eu
          containers:
          # ...
    ```
    You must do this for all database deployments, `prometheus.yaml`, `grafana.yaml`, and `zipkin.yaml`.

4.  **Update your PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)** to use the OpenEBS `StorageClass` and remove the static `PersistentVolume` definitions. This will allow Kubernetes to dynamically provision replicated storage for your pods wherever they are scheduled.

    For example, you should delete the `PersistentVolume` for `authentication-db-pv` from `storage.yaml` and modify the `PersistentVolumeClaim` like this:

    <llm-snippet-file>kubernetes/storage.yaml</llm-snippet-file>
    ```yaml
    # Delete the corresponding PersistentVolume definition for authentication-db-pv
    
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: authentication-db-pvc
      namespace: microservices
    spec:
      # Replace 'openebs-cstor-csi' with your actual replicated StorageClass name
      storageClassName: openebs-cstor-csi
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 5Gi
    # ... (repeat for all other PVCs)
    ```

By making these changes, you will transform your setup into a truly distributed and resilient system. Your cluster will be able to tolerate a node failure without becoming completely unreachable.

==== Message #8 ====
Assistant: 
Thank you for providing the output of `k0s status` and `k0s sysinfo` for the `nbs2` node.

From the `k0s status` output, we can see that `nbs2` is a controller node, but it is not configured to run workloads (`Workloads: false`). This is a very important piece of information.

The `k0s sysinfo` output shows that the node has sufficient resources and the correct kernel modules for Kubernetes to function correctly.

However, the fact that `nbs2` is a controller-only node and your other two nodes (`35591.hostserv.eu` and `nbs1`) are `controller+worker` nodes changes the situation significantly. It means that `nbs2` is not participating in running any of your application pods.

This reinforces the single point of failure problem on `35591.hostserv.eu`, but it also means my previous recommendation to add the IP of `nbs1` to MetalLB needs to be adjusted.

Here's the updated analysis and recommendation:

### The Core Problem Remains the Same

The core of the problem is still the single point of failure on the `35591.hostserv.eu` node. All your stateful applications are tied to it, and it's the only node with an external IP address advertised by MetalLB.

### Revised Solution

Given that `nbs2` is a controller-only node, you should make `nbs1` a fully functional worker node that can take over if `35591.hostserv.eu` fails.

Here are the revised steps:

#### Step 1: Make Your Network Highly Available

You need to add the IP address of your other `controller+worker` node, `nbs1` (`91.99.143.250`), to your MetalLB configuration. This will allow MetalLB to serve traffic from either worker node.

<llm-snippet-file>kubernetes/metallb-config.yaml</llm-snippet-file>
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: public-ips
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 185.229.90.248/32
    - 91.99.143.250/32 # Add the IP of your other worker node
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: public-ips-advertisement
  namespace: metallb-system

```

#### Step 2: Distribute Your Stateful Applications

This part of the recommendation remains the same. You need to use a replicated storage solution like OpenEBS to allow your stateful applications to run on either of your worker nodes (`35591.hostserv.eu` or `nbs1`).

1.  **IMPORTANT**: **Back up your data before proceeding!**

2.  **Find a replicated OpenEBS StorageClass.** Run `kubectl get sc` to find a suitable storage class.

3.  **Remove the `nodeSelector`** from all your stateful `Deployment` files (`authentication-db.yaml`, `usermanagement-db.yaml`, `chess-db.yaml`, `fitness-db.yaml`, `music-db.yaml`, `prometheus.yaml`, `grafana.yaml`, and `zipkin.yaml`).

4.  **Update your PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)** to use the replicated OpenEBS `StorageClass` and remove the static `PersistentVolume` definitions from `storage.yaml`.

By implementing these changes, you will have a much more resilient and highly available Kubernetes cluster. Your workloads will be distributed across your two worker nodes, and your cluster will be able to tolerate the failure of a single node without going down.

==== Message #10 ====
Assistant: 
Thank you for providing the status of the `35591.hostserv.eu` node. This information is very helpful and confirms my previous analysis.

Here’s a summary of what we know about your cluster setup:

*   **`nbs2` (`5.75.129.76`):** A dedicated controller node that does not run application workloads.
*   **`35591.hostserv.eu` (`185.229.90.248`):** A controller and worker node. It has a good amount of memory (11.7 GiB) and disk space (251.2 GiB).
*   **`nbs1` (`91.99.143.250`):** Also a controller and worker node.

The output confirms that `35591.hostserv.eu` is healthy and has plenty of resources *right now*. However, your configuration files create a critical **single point of failure** on this specific node, which is the most likely reason your cluster becomes unreachable after 1-2 days.

### The Unchanged Core Problem: Single Point of Failure

1.  **All Stateful Workloads on One Node**: Your YAML files use a `nodeSelector` to force all of your databases (`music-db`, `chess-db`, etc.), monitoring tools (`prometheus`, `grafana`), and `zipkin` to run *only* on `35591.hostserv.eu`.
2.  **All Network Traffic to One Node**: Your `metallb-config.yaml` assigns an external IP address that belongs exclusively to `35591.hostserv.eu`. This means all incoming user traffic is directed solely to this node.

A gradual problem, like a memory leak in one of your services or high database load, will slowly consume the resources of the `35591.hostserv.eu` node. After 1-2 days, the node becomes overloaded and unresponsive, taking your entire application stack down with it.

### The Solution: Building a High-Availability Cluster

The solution I recommended previously is the correct path forward. You must distribute your workloads and network traffic across your two worker nodes (`35591.hostserv.eu` and `nbs1`) to build a resilient, highly available system.

Here is the step-by-step solution again for clarity:

#### Step 1: Make Your Network Highly Available

Update your `metallb-config.yaml` to include the IP address of your second worker node, `nbs1`. This allows network traffic to be balanced between both nodes.

<llm-snippet-file>kubernetes/metallb-config.yaml</llm-snippet-file>
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: public-ips
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 185.229.90.248/32
    - 91.99.143.250/32 # Add the IP of your 'nbs1' worker node
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: public-ips-advertisement
  namespace: metallb-system
```

#### Step 2: Distribute Your Stateful Applications with Replicated Storage

You must stop pinning your stateful applications to a single node. The best way to do this is by using a replicated storage provider like OpenEBS, which you already have installed.

1.  **Backup Your Data**: This is a critical first step before making storage changes.
2.  **Use a Replicated StorageClass**: Identify a replicated `StorageClass` from your OpenEBS installation (e.g., `openebs-cstor-csi` or `openebs-jiva-csi-default`) by running `kubectl get sc`.
3.  **Remove `nodeSelector`**: Delete the `nodeSelector` block from all of your stateful deployments (`authentication-db.yaml`, `prometheus.yaml`, etc.).
4.  **Update PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)**: Modify all your PVCs in `storage.yaml` and other files. Remove the manually defined `PersistentVolume`s and update the PVCs to use the replicated OpenEBS `storageClassName`.

Here is the example for the `authentication-db` PVC again:

<llm-snippet-file>kubernetes/storage.yaml</llm-snippet-file>
```yaml
# Delete the corresponding PersistentVolume definition for authentication-db-pv

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: authentication-db-pvc
  namespace: microservices
spec:
  # Replace with your actual replicated StorageClass name
  storageClassName: openebs-cstor-csi 
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
# --- (Repeat for all other PVCs)
```

By following these two steps, you will resolve the single point of failure. Your cluster will be properly balanced, stable, and able to withstand the failure of a single worker node without a complete outage.

But it doesnt help to restart 35591 and nbs1. Its still unreachable

kotlin.Unit

==== Message #12 ====
Assistant: 
Thank you for that crucial information. The fact that rebooting the worker nodes (`35591.hostserv.eu` and `nbs1`) does not fix the problem is a very important clue.

This tells us the issue is likely not a simple resource leak (like memory or CPU) on the nodes, as a restart would clear that. Instead, it points to a more persistent problem in the cluster's state or, much more likely, in the interaction between your cluster and your physical network hardware.

### A New Theory: A Network-Layer Problem

Based on this new information, the most likely culprit is an issue with how **MetalLB's L2 advertisement mode is interacting with your physical switches or routers.**

Here’s a simple explanation of what's likely happening:

1.  **Normal Operation**: For high availability, you have two worker nodes. MetalLB advertises your external IP address (e.g., `185.229.90.248`) from one of the healthy nodes (let's say `35591`). Your network switch learns that the path to that IP is through the MAC address of the `35591` server.
2.  **The Trigger**: After 1-2 days, something happens. It could be that the `35591` node comes under heavy load (due to all the databases pinned to it), or a network event occurs. Kubernetes might try to move a critical pod (like Traefik) to the other node, `nbs1`.
3.  **The Failure Point**: The MetalLB `speaker` pod on `nbs1` now advertises the *same* IP address but with `nbs1`'s MAC address. It is effectively telling the switch, "Hey, the path to this IP has changed!"
4.  **The Black Hole**: Some networking hardware has security features (like "sticky MAC" or ARP filtering) that cause it to ignore these announcements. The switch refuses to update its internal table and continues sending traffic for that IP to the original, now-overloaded or non-responsive, `35591` node.

This creates a network black hole. Rebooting the nodes doesn't help because as they come back online, they trigger the exact same network announcements, and the physical switch makes the same mistake again.

### Diagnostic Step to Confirm the Theory

To test this, you can temporarily disable the high-availability feature of MetalLB and force it to *only* advertise from a single, specific node. If this makes your cluster stable for more than 2 days, it will confirm that the issue is with the multi-node L2 advertisements.

Here is how you can modify your `metallb-config.yaml` to pin the advertisement to the `35591.hostserv.eu` node:

<llm-snippet-file>kubernetes/metallb-config.yaml</llm-snippet-file>
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: public-ips
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 185.229.90.248/32
    - 91.99.143.250/32
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: public-ips-advertisement
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  nodeSelector:
  - matchLabels:
      kubernetes.io/hostname: 35591.hostserv.eu
```

By adding the `nodeSelector` to the `L2Advertisement`, you are telling MetalLB to only ever use that one specific node to announce IPs to your network. This will sacrifice network high-availability temporarily, but it's a critical step for diagnosis.

### Long-Term Solution

If the diagnostic step above stabilizes your cluster, the long-term solution involves investigating your physical network equipment:

1.  **Check Switch/Router Logs**: Look for any logs related to "MAC flapping," "ARP spoofing," "GARP," or security violations on the ports connected to your cluster nodes.
2.  **Consult MetalLB Documentation**: The [MetalLB documentation](https://metallb.universe.tf/configuration/_advanced_l2/) has an excellent section on troubleshooting L2 mode, as this is a common environmental issue.
3.  **Consider BGP Mode**: For the most robust setup, MetalLB can use BGP instead of L2/ARP. This requires a BGP-capable router but is the standard for production-grade network load balancing.

I still strongly recommend you follow the previous advice to **distribute your stateful workloads using OpenEBS and remove the `nodeSelector` from your database deployments.** Overloading the `35591.hostserv.eu` node is likely a contributing factor that triggers the network issue in the first place.

# k0s and k0sctl

This document provides information about k0s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, and k0sctl, a tool for managing k0s clusters.

## Overview

k0s is a complete Kubernetes distribution packaged as a single binary, designed to be simple to install and operate.

k0sctl is a command-line tool that helps deploy and manage k0s clusters across multiple nodes. It uses SSH to connect to the target hosts and automates the installation and configuration of k0s.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that:

- You have at least one server for a single-node setup or multiple servers for a multi-node cluster
- Each server has at least 1 CPU, 1GB RAM, and 10GB disk space
- All servers have static IP addresses and can communicate with each other
- You have SSH access to all servers
- All servers have unique hostnames

## k0sctl Configuration

The k0sctl tool uses a YAML configuration file to define the cluster. 

### Configuration Explanation

The configuration file defines:

1. **Cluster Metadata**: The name of the cluster (`microservice-cluster`).

2. **Hosts**: The servers that will form the cluster:
   - A controller node at 5.75.129.76
   - Two controller+worker nodes at 185.229.90.248 and 91.99.143.250
   - Each host has SSH connection details including address, user, port, and SSH key path

3. **k0s Configuration**:
   - Version: v1.33.2+k0s.0
   - Network configuration with node local load balancing enabled using EnvoyProxy
   - Storage type set to etcd
   - Telemetry enabled

4. **Options**:
   - Wait for operations to complete
   - Drain settings for node maintenance
   - Concurrency settings for parallel operations
   - Eviction taint configuration


## Deploying a k0s Cluster with k0sctl

1. Create a k0sctl configuration file (as shown above) and save it as `k0sctl.yaml`.

2. Apply the configuration to create or update the cluster:

```bash
k0sctl apply --config k0sctl.yaml
```

3. Verify the cluster status:

```bash
k0sctl kubectl get nodes
k0sctl kubectl get pods -A
```

## Accessing the Cluster

After deploying the cluster, k0sctl can generate a kubeconfig file for accessing it:

```bash
k0sctl kubeconfig --config k0sctl.yaml > ~/.kube/config
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A
```

Now you can use kubectl to interact with your cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A
```

## Upgrading the Cluster

To upgrade a k0s cluster:

1. Update the version in your k0sctl.yaml file:

```yaml
k0s:
  version: v1.33.3+k0s.0  # New version
```

2. Apply the updated configuration:

```bash
k0sctl apply --config k0sctl.yaml
```

## Resetting the Cluster

If you need to reset the cluster:

```bash
k0sctl reset --config k0sctl.yaml
```

This will uninstall k0s from all hosts defined in the configuration.

==== Message #14 ====
Assistant: 
You are absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for the error in my previous message. The `kubectl apply` command failed because I gave you a YAML configuration with an incorrect field name. Thank you for posting the error message; it clearly shows my mistake.

The MetalLB API for an `L2Advertisement` expects the field to be `nodeSelectors` (plural), not `nodeSelector` (singular).

Please use the following corrected version of `metallb-config.yaml`. This will apply the diagnostic step correctly.

<llm-snippet-file>kubernetes/metallb-config.yaml</llm-snippet-file>
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: public-ips
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 185.229.90.248/32
    - 91.99.143.250/32
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: public-ips-advertisement
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  nodeSelectors: # <-- Corrected from nodeSelector to nodeSelectors
  - matchLabels:
      kubernetes.io/hostname: 35591.hostserv.eu
```

After applying this change, MetalLB will be forced to advertise the external IP only from the `35591.hostserv.eu` node. This is still a temporary diagnostic step to see if it stabilizes your cluster over the next couple of days.

### The Underlying Architectural Issue

While the change above will help diagnose the network issue, please remember that your cluster's core problem remains the single point of failure on the `35591.hostserv.eu` node.

Your `db-backup.yaml` file further highlights this dependency. The backup `PersistentVolume` (`db-backup-pv`) is also locked to that same single node using `nodeAffinity`:

```yaml
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
              operator: In
              values:
                - 35591.hostserv.eu
```

This means if that node goes down, not only does your application become unreachable, but your database backups will also fail.

Once we confirm the network stability with the diagnostic step, the next priority should be to follow the original advice to distribute your stateful applications using OpenEBS and remove all `nodeSelector` and `nodeAffinity` rules that tie your storage and workloads to a single machine.

User: 
Now it works and is reachable again

kotlin.Unit

==== Message #16 ====
Assistant: 
Excellent! Thank you for confirming. The fact that the cluster is immediately reachable and stable after locking the L2 advertisement to a single node is the "smoking gun."

This strongly confirms our theory: **The root cause of the periodic unreachability is your physical network hardware (switch or router) not correctly handling the IP address failover between your two worker nodes.**

### What Was Happening

1.  **Normal State**: MetalLB would advertise the external IP from one of your worker nodes (e.g., `35591.hostserv.eu`). Your switch learned the path to the IP.
2.  **Trigger**: When load increased or Kubernetes rescheduled a key pod, MetalLB would try to be helpful and move the IP advertisement to your other worker node (`nbs1`).
3.  **The Failure**: Your network switch, for security or configuration reasons, rejected this "move" announcement. It kept sending traffic to the original node, which was no longer serving the IP, causing a network black hole and making your services unreachable.
4.  **The "Fix"**: By adding the `nodeSelectors` rule, you have forbidden MetalLB from ever moving the IP advertisement. It is now permanently locked to `35591.hostserv.eu`, which makes the network stable but removes the high availability you were trying to achieve.

### This Is a Diagnostic Step, Not a Permanent Solution

Your cluster is working now, but you have traded the periodic failure for a different problem: **you have a single point of failure again.** If the `35591.hostserv.eu` node goes down for any reason, your entire cluster will become unreachable.

### The Permanent Solutions

You have two primary paths to a robust, long-term solution:

#### Option 1: Fix the L2 Network Environment (If Possible)

This involves investigating the configuration of the physical network switch that your servers are connected to. This is a very common issue when using L2-based load balancing.
*   **What to look for**: Check the switch's administration panel or logs for settings like:
    *   `Sticky MAC`
    *   `MAC Flapping` or `MAC Move` protection
    *   `ARP Filtering` or `ARP Spoofing` protection
    *   Port Security
*   **Action**: These features often need to be disabled or configured to be more permissive on the ports connected to your Kubernetes nodes to allow the IP address to float between them.

#### Option 2: Switch to a More Robust Protocol (BGP)

This is the industry-standard and recommended method for production clusters. Instead of using L2/ARP announcements, which can be unreliable, MetalLB can speak the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) directly with your router.
*   **How it works**: Your cluster peers with your router. When an IP needs to be advertised, the cluster tells the router directly, "send traffic for this IP to me." This is much more reliable and avoids the L2 MAC address issues entirely.
*   **Requirement**: This requires a network router that supports BGP. Most modern enterprise or prosumer routers do. You would need to check your router's capabilities.

### Don't Forget the Original Problem

While you decide on the networking path, please do not forget the original architectural issue. The reason MetalLB was likely trying to move the IP in the first place was because the `35591.hostserv.eu` node was becoming overloaded by running all of your stateful applications.

I still strongly recommend you proceed with the plan to **distribute your stateful applications using OpenEBS and remove the `nodeAffinity` and `nodeSelector` rules from your storage and database configurations.** This will create a balanced, stable cluster and reduce the chance of any single node becoming a performance bottleneck.
