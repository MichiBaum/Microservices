My journey in the world of IT began with an apprenticeship at Würth ITensis from 2017 to 2021, where I honed my skills and continued working until 2024. During this time, I developed a deep passion for programming, which I continue to pursue in my free time.",

    "s3": "On the frontend side, I've worked with technologies like HTML, CSS, JSP, JavaScript, Knockout.js, and Angular \uD83C\uDFA8. But my interests don’t stop there! I'm also passionate about software architecture \uD83C\uDFDB\uFE0F, IT security \uD83D\uDD12, and team management \uD83D\uDC65—essentially, anything related to the IT world excites me \uD83D\uDE80.",
