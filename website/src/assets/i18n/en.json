    "s1": "Hello! I'm a software developer from Switzerland. My journey in the world of IT began with an apprenticeship at Würth ITensis from 2017 to 2021, where I honed my skills and continued working until 2024. During this time, I developed a deep passion for programming, which I continue to pursue in my free time.",
    "s2": "I’m particularly fond of Java and the Spring Framework ☕🌱, which I used extensively in my professional work. When working on personal backend projects, I prefer to use Kotlin, as I like the null safety and functional style 💡.",
    "s3": "On the frontend side, I've worked with technologies like HTML, CSS, JSP, JavaScript, Knockout.js, and Angular 🎨. But my interests don’t stop there! I'm also passionate about software architecture 🏛️, IT security 🔒, and team management 👥—essentially, anything related to the IT world excites me 🚀.",
    "s4": "When I’m not coding, I’m likely reading up on the latest developments in tech or brainstorming new projects. I’m always eager to grow, learn, and take on new challenges.",
